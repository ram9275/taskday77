# taskday77 - Through my exploration of SVM, I've grasped that support vectors are crucial points defining the optimal separating hyperplane, maximizing classification margin. The C parameter balances misclassification tolerance—smaller values allow a wider margin, while larger values aim for perfection but risk overfitting. Kernels enhance SVM by transforming data into higher dimensions, enabling classification even when it appears inseparable in its original form. The linear kernel suits simple separable data, whereas the RBF kernel is powerful for complex decision boundaries, adjusting influence through the gamma parameter. I appreciate SVM for its robustness in high-dimensional spaces and its resilience against overfitting when tuned properly. Beyond classification, I've learned about Support Vector Regression (SVR), which focuses on fitting data within a margin rather than strict boundary separation. When data is not linearly separable, kernel methods help project it into a space where separation is possible. Overfitting in SVM is handled through careful tuning of C and gamma, alongside techniques like cross-validation that ensure the model generalizes well. Through these steps, I’ve gained confidence in training, optimizing, and evaluating SVM models effectively.
